different from the herbal, spicy, or ""cut grass"" aromas of other hop varieties.  Harpoon IPA has three malts. One adds a toasted flavor and the other a malty flavor. Along 
with the third malt, a 2-row pale, there is an abundance of fermentable sugar to be converted 
into alcohol, which accounts for the relatively high original gravity.  
The high hopping of Harpoon IPA is not only noticeable in the nose but especially in the finish.
